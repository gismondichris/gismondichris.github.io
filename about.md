I have spent the last {{lab_years}} years working in 6 different roles 
for the Environmental Laboratory for the Florida Department of Agriculture. 
During my time in these roles, I was repeatedly exposed to technological challenges. 
Can we build this report? How can we automate these calculations? Can 
we reformat these files? Is there a way to automate this? I dove into these challenges 
head first and eventually found myself coordinated all the tech and data needs for my lab.

For the past {{ tech_years }} years I have worked on tech projects ranging from small PowerShell scripts for 
automation to database design. My interest grew as I was given more projects 
and I decided to pursue a second Bachelor's in Computer Science. 

I am currently looking to take the skills I developed and 
step into more complex programming and/or networking roles. 

This site highlights some of the languages 
and tools I have used. It also describes some of the projects 
I have completed. Finally, I have listed my roles and what some of responsibilities in those roles were.
