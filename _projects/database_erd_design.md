title: Database ERD Design
roles:
  - Laboratory Data Manager

#### Summary
I created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for a 
standards and reagents database.

#### Description
The database was intended to replace paper forms that 
recorded reagents and standards that were prepared in 
the laboratory. As such, it would function as a 
standards and reagents inventory.

All the items and actions related to an inventory were modelled 
in the design I submitted. Some of the items included:
- Standard type
- Vendor
- Manufacturer
- Expiration dates
- Hazards

There were plans to implement the database and then use Power 
Apps to create the front-end for users. Unfortunately, there was 
a change in leadership on the IT side and the project was abandoned.
I did however, get to complete and submit the ERD design.
