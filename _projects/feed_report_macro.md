#### Summary
This is the first programming adjacent project I ever worked on.
It simply takes data in an excel file and reformats it so 
that it can be submitted to an online portal.

#### Description
This project consisted of using Excel's record feature to create a macro to 
reformat data. However, there were issues that the record feature did not account for
very well. So I began to look into the generated code.

I googled what I needed to do and was able to resolve this issue. More importantly, this project 
introduced me to the world of coding. Shortly after completing this project,
I started teaching myself Python and using it to automate tasks in the 
lab.
