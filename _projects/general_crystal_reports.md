#### Summary
This is less a project and more a task that I completed frequently.
I maintained all the crystal reports for our laboratory 
and generated new reports as needed.

#### Description
The laboratory used crystal reports for a variety of internal data 
needs but also used it to generate official reports sent to customers.

I was responsible for creating any new reports that were needed and 
modifying old reports. Most cases were simple, but there were times where I had to use
extensive formulas to achieve what was requested.

It was often necessary to meet with people to discuss what 
exactly they were trying to accomplish and communicate any 
limitations that Crystal Reports had.
