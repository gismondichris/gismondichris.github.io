This website was generated using Jekyll. The source code can
be viewed [here](https://github.com/gismondichris/gismondichris.github.io).

Jekyll uses [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/),
and [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). However, this is my first and 
only project using these tools. This shows that I am capable 
of using these tools, but I still have a lot to learn.

As a part of building this website, I made a few HTML documents to use as templates. 
I also utilize liquid quite extensively to encode logic into HTML and markdown 
documents. The templates and css were modified from the existing [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) template.

The built-in front matter tags were used to relate pages to one another.

The server is managed entirely by GitHub. I simply wrote front end for this website.
