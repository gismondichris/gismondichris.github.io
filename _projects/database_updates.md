#### Summary
Less a project, and more a consistent aspect of my data 
manager role. This involved identifying problems with our Laboratory 
Information Management System (LIMS) and writing SQL update scripts 
to remedy the problem.

#### Description
The laboratory uses a purchased LIMS to store, view, and 
modify data. The LIMS consists of user facing desktop and web 
applications and an Oracle database backend.

I was responsible for maintaining the LIMS. So whenever there was 
a problem with the LIMS I would check the database to see if there
were any issues. Some of the identified problems included missing columns, 
missing tables, and missing public synonymns. I would then write SQL 
scripts to fix the problems.

Because of our IT strucutre, I was not allowed to directly edit the database.
So I would coordinate with the vendor to confirm that my scripts were correct, 
and then submit them to IT for completion.
