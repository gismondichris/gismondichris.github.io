#### Summary
My latest experience in this role was in the Chemist Administrator position.
In this position, I launched a new water nutrients program for our lab. 
This experience exposed me to the challenges of laboratory and project management.

#### Positions
I performed this role as part of my Chemist Administrator (2018-2020) and Environmental Specialist I 
(2017-2018) positions. Unless stated otherwise, all of what I will talk about below related to the Chemist Administrator position.
My time as an Environmental Specialist I began developing many of the same skills, but they were all honed 
in the Chemist Administrator posiiton.

#### Technolgy
While I was still the Chemist Adminsitrator, I used the skills I had begun 
to develop in Python and VBA in particular to automate tasks in my section 
(see [related projects](#related-projects)).

#### Launch of Water Nutrients Program
As part of the water nutrient program launch I did all of the following:
- Purchased all needed equipment
- Hired and trained new employees
- Wrote Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's)
- Oversaw all operations of the program
- Managed an annual budget
- Created workflow
- Coordinated between all relevant parties
- Reviewed data 
- Reported data
I thoroughly enjoyed being part of a project from the ground level.
It gave me a degree of input that is not typical for a manager. 

In my management experience the most important skills I have developed are
leadership, project management, and quality assurance.

#### Leadership 
The tasks that managers are asked to 
complete is too numerous to list. Below
are some selected tasks I had to complete:
- Resolving interpersonal conflict
- Managing schedules
- Planning meetings
- Developing a culture of respect
- Setting expectations
- Communicating changes
- Advocating to upper management for improvements
- Delegating work
- Empowering and encouraging employees
- Providing feedback quickly, clearly, and fairly

#### Project Management 
Since the water nutrients program was starting from nothing, I had 
the unique opputunity to participate in the planning, implementation, 
and manintenance of this program. I experienced all the 
growing pains of new project first hand.

This was my first major exposure to concepts such as risk management, 
deliverables, scope creep, and stakeholders. The relationships I built 
both inside our organization and outside our orgnaization were 
absolutely critical in being able to deliver our project on time and 
under budget.

#### Quality Assurance 
The water nutrients project needed to be accredited by [TNI](https://nelac-institute.org/).
I was lucky that out laboratory had previous experience with TNI. This 
meant that most of the major peices were already in place.

However, I was still ulitmately responsible for making sure we met all 
requirements. I learned about and implemented quality assurance ideas
such as document control, SOP's, preventative actions, 
corrective actions, non-conformances, deviations, method validation, etc.
