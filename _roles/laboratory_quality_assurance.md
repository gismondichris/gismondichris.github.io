title: Laboratory Quality Assurance
---

#### Summary
As a part of the quality assurance team and as a 
laboratory manager, I particapating in all aspects of 
quality assurance for our laboratory. This topic can 
be incredibly wide ranging, but is essentially deploying and 
improving systems that ensure reliable results are produced. As part of this team I would participate in QA meetings,
perform internal audits, cover all aspects of document control, and 
participate in external audits. I became deeply familiar with 
our 2 accreditations we maintained: [TNI](https://nelac-institute.org/) and 
[ISO 17025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_17025).

#### Positions
I performed this role as part of my Chemist Specialist (2022-present) position.

#### Systems Oriented
Our approach to quality assurance at the lab was to focus on systems. That is,
we did not seek to ask "Who did this?" but rather "Why did this happen?". 
If any portion of that answer involved our systems, then 
this became a quality asssurance (QA) issue. To date, almost every identified non-conformance
has been traceable to a system issue.

This has given me a system-oriented mindset when it comes to solving problems. 
Rather than seeking to blame individuals, I seek to understand what 
systems can be improved or introduced to prevent issues in the future. For example,
many of our non-conformances stated "training" as the root cause. This led our QA 
team to suggest restructuring our training program.

#### Training Restructure

I was assigned this task alongside my 
other duties. As part of this task, I was responsible for restructuring our 
training program from the ground up. This was a long term project that took over 8 months 
to execute. Some of the needs of the restructure included:
- Evaluating the current system 
- Performing risk analysis on the current and proposed systems
- Working with a management team that was overburdened
- Creating a sense of ownership for all participants
- Ensuring the system worked across programs with different needs
- Maintaining a fair system

#### Internal and External audits

I performed internal audits and participated in our external audits. 
These audits were vital in ensuring that our data quality 
remained high. The preparation for our external audits involved 
a complete review of the standard that we were being audited for 
and ensuring that every area of the lab was complying with that standard.
