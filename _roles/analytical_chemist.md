#### Summary
As an analytical chemist, my primary job was to prepare and analyze 
samples for specific analytes.

#### Positions
I performed this role as part of my Lab Tech IV (2016-2017), 
Environmental Specialist I (2017-2018), Environmental Specialist I (2018), 
Chemist Administrator (2018-2020), and Environmental Specialist III (2020-2022) positions.

#### Technology and Programming
During my time as a chemist, I began to notice many oppurtunties for 
technological automations and improvements. This is when I learned 
Python and VBA. I used those skills to begin formatting data and 
automating tasks for myself. This eventually led to bigger 
projects and more responsibilties as the [laboratory data manager]({% link _roles/laboratory_data_manager.md %}).

#### Detailed Work
Attention to detail is paramount in a laboratory, both for safety and 
quality results. Even seemingly inconsequential actions could result in 
safety concerns or failing analytical results. Repeatedly performing 
the same actions with precision was a skill I honed in this role.

#### Maintenance and Troubleshooting
One of the most important aspects of laboratory work is maintaining and 
troubleshooting instrumentation. This involves following set procedures, 
documentation, reading manuals, consulting in-house experts, and 
contacting vendors. As with all troubleshooting, I learned the 
value of changing one thing at a time to succefully isolate the issue. It was 
also important to always start with the easiest fix before moving to more difficult ones.

#### Laboratory Skills
In my time in the laboratory I performed analyses using the following:
- [Kjeldahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kjeldahl_method) for Nitrogen 
- [Gavimetric analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravimetric_analysis) for Sulfur, 
- [Flow Injection Anlysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_injection_analysis), 
- [High Performance Liquid Chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_liquid_chromatography) (HPLC) with a 
[Photodiode Array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodiode) (PDA) for Cannabinoids
- [Combustion analyzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion_analysis) for Total Organic Carbon (TOC)

I also performed a variety of different sample prepartaions:
- Sample Homogenization
- Sample Splitting (Subsampling)
- Acid digestions
- Available phosphate extraction
- Sample dilution
- [Solid Phase Extraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-phase_extraction)

Then there are the general laboratory skills which all chemists are familiar with:
- Weighing
- Pipetting
- Reagent Creation
- Standard Creation
- Standard/Sample dilution
- Matrix spiking
- Quality control samples (positive, negative, duplicates, etc.)
