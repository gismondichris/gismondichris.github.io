I have a fair amount of experience with writing 
simple DML SQL scripts (UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE) for 
the database that stores all of our laboratory data. I also
written DDL scripts to add public synonyms, add tables, and add columns.
See the [database updates]({% link _projects/database_updates.md %}) project for more details.

I use SQL from time to time when creating cystal reports.

I took an educational course on SQL where we had to write stored 
procedures and triggers.
