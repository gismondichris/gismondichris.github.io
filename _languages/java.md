My Java experience has been mostly in the educational field. I am 
currently enrolled in 2 courses that heavily use Java: Android Programming 
and Web Applications. Through these courses I have been introduced to 
Maven as a package manager.

I find it easy to read Java as it straddles the line between C++ and 
Python, two languages which I am more familiar with. My actual use of the language 
is fairly limited at this point. Though this will change in the near future 
as I complete the courses mentioned above.
