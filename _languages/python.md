Python is my main language. Almost all of my professional 
coding projects have been completed in Python. I have also taken 
several educational courses that heavily utilized the language.

If I have a choice of programming languages and efficiency is not a 
major concern, I will choose Python. This is especially true if I 
need to complete the project quickly.

The related projects are a fair sampling of the kinds of work I have done 
in Python.

For package management I use some combination of [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) and 
[Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) for most 
of my projects. 

I often use [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) when importing or exporting data.

I have used [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) but not extensively.
