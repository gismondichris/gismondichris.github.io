I have created and maintained a variety of crystal 
reports for the laboratory. These reports were 
used for both internal and external customers.

I would describe myself as very familiar with the basics 
and more than capable of writing decent formulas. I will note
that the version of Crystal Reports I am familiar with 
is an older version, so I may need a little transition time 
if moving to a newer version.
