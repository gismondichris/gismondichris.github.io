I have used Git for years to manage my personal and work projects. 
Most of the time, I utilize the commands available through IDE's like 
PyCharm. I have also utilize terminal commands as needed. I was the sole person 
making commits for all of my projects except for one educatoinal project.

I used Git for version control and to ensure that all changes on a given branch were
available on all my devices.
