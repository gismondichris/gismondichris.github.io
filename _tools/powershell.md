roles:
  - Laboratory Data Manager
projects:
  - Automatic Network Drive Connection

I have written one [script]({% link _projects/automatic_network_drive_connection.md %}) 
that has been utilized in the laboratory. My experience is therefore limited in terms of writing
scripts.

I will often use PowerShell when setting up projects or running commands 
for software development related tools (git, maven, etc.). So I am familiar with 
the basics and comfortable learning on the fly.
